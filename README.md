# AI4ER Project Generation Cookiecutter
This cookiecutter provides a quick and easy way to create new projects for most environmental data science research projects. 

## Usage
To use this cookiecutter, you simply type

```cookiecutter https://github.com/ai4er-cdt/ai4er-cookiecutter.git``` 

into the command line. The cookiecutter will then automatically prompt you to set project names, etc.

The current version of the ai4er-cookiecutter allows you to automatically set up:
1. A useful folderstructure for notebooks, source code, documentation, etc.
2. Automatically create a symlink to your data folder for easy and unified data access.
3. Automatically initialize as github repo and link to an existing (empty!) repository on github.com
4. Automatically create a new conda environment for your project and store it in the projects `/env` subdirectory.
